# Vectorfield-Pathfinding : a study

Vectorfield pathfinding is a new approach on pathfinding algorithms. It allows to compute the shortest path to a target for every points
of a map, in one single calculation, aknowledging obstacles.

This repo is the full code for the website https://nnnawi.github.io/Vectorfield-Pathfinding, that explains the idea of vectorfield pathfinding and how to construct it. Further, I present a personnal study
on how to optimize the different methods and parameters used in the algorithms *(in order to better suit criterias of smoothness or divergence for instance)*.
